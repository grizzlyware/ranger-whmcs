# Ranger for WHMCS
Dispense and validate license keys for your apps, via WHMCS.

## Premise
Ranger was built to be application and transport layer agnostic. You can run the client and server in any PHP application to generate, callback and validate license keys. The communication between the client and the server can happen over any layer, be that HTTP/S, MQTT, SMS or a postcard.
